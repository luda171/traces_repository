This\nfeature makes it easy to organize content and to refer to other pages. Each file with extension .md is a content file that corresponds to a website\npage. Upon a website build, each content file is compiled into a .html page.\nAll other files and directories are copied to the website, except those whose\nnames start with an underscore _ . Content files A content file starts with a section between triple dashes --- .  This is the\nYAML frontmatter with page variables such as title and layout . After the frontmatter follows the actual content. The format is Markdown with\nextensions . Layouts Each content file uses the layout variable to specify the look of the \npage. Urubu Quickstart defines a number of layouts. The page layout yields a page\nwith a sidebar for the table of contents. If you don't need a sidebar, use the simple_page layout. Reference ids Urubu resolves reference ids in Markdown content, specified by\nthe syntax [<reference-id>] . Reference ids are names that refer to links. In Urubu, the pathname of a page\nor folder (without extension) can be used as its reference id. In addition, the reflinks variable in file _site.yml defines reference ids for external\nurls. Folders A project subdirectory maps to a folder on the website.  The folder content is\ndefined in the index.md file.  The first option is to list the folder content\nexplicitly in content variable, as a list of reference ids.  As an example,\nsee Manual demo .  The second option is to specify the content ordering. For\nexample, for a blog you would set the order variable to date , and the reverse variable to true .  As an example, see Blog demo . For index.md files, you can use the index layout, which lists the contents\nof the folder. Navbar The navbar at the top is defined by the content variable of the top-level index.md file.",
